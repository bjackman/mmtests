### This a benchmark that stresses THP allocations in a specific manner.
###
### THPCOMPACT_MAPSIZE is split based on the number of active threads at
### each stage of the test. The active memory for a thread is referred
### to as THREAD_MAPSIZE
###
### 1. It first creates a large THREAD_MAPSIZE anonymous mapping that is THP
###    aligned, specifies madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE) and faults it. It then punches
###    holes in the (hopefully) THP mapping that are naturally aligned and
###    half the size of a THP. This mapping is a migration source that frees
###    pageblocks as the pages are moved. At this point, the migration source
###    only has anonymous pages.
###
### 2. It then creates a THREAD_MAPSIZE/2 anonymous mapping that is not yet
###    faulted. The size of this mapping represents the sum of the holes created
###    in step 1.
###
### 3. A file mapping is created of size THREAD_MAPSIZE/4 and the file is
###    read-faulted. These are also potential migration sources as some of
###    the holes will be used to store file-backed pages.
###
### 4. Finally the anonymous mapping created at step 2 is faulted while
###    recording the time to fault, the locality and whether a huge page
###    is used.
###
### The overall size of the workload is such that it should fit in memory while
### requiring compaction to allocate THPs for the final mapping.
